# Wacca Translate Update
For updating translation project to newer versions
WIP

The already Translated file must be named "SystemMessageTranslated.json"

The New file that you want to port the translation too must be named "SystemMessageNew.json"

Put both files in the same folder as the exe of this program

It is HIGHLY recommended that you backup both files somewhere else before running this program. (Having a copy that's a different name than the required names also works)

Assets that have different japanese text on the old translated json and the new json will be listed in changes.txt when the program is ran
